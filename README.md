# About the software

Developers work day and night to provide an exquisite experience to the user, This program is developed for those programmers who work all day every day when they use this app it shows all the usage of the variety of apps they use this helps them find a balance with technology. 
This program is developed on golang. It uses the focused window property of the Xorg-server and calculates the time spent in each window and adds it to a JSON file, the golang GUI reads the JSON file from the backend create_json server app and represents it as a chart. As this window appears and the keyboard is disabled and the window is unkillable. This helps a developer to take a break at regular intervals and help manage a digital wellbeing.
